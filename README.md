# ArizWebProjectWorkshop
Hello everyone!

This is a website that I created when I attended an HTML & CSS workshop at my university.
This website is basically for people who want to know me more, I state my favorite things and my contacts on the website page.
I studied how to develop a simple website page by using basic HTML and CSS,
as well as implementing Materialize as A modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design.

See how it looks now!
